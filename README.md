**Senior Thesis** 

-Many have investigated the social influence on academic performance in an academic setting using network theory. 
However, they do not account for a student’s relative academic standing. 
This matters because one’s relative academic standing could either encourage the student to work harder or make the student become complacent.
I want to fill this gap by comparing the effects of being the one with lowest GPA/QPA and being the one with highest GPA/QPA in a social network in an
academic environment. My study focuses on the academic performances and network among Hungarian primary school students. Does one improve more over time by being surrounded by those who are more intellectual than oneself? We hypothesize that simply being surrounded by ones with
higher GPA does not alone lead to the improvement over time. Instead, we anticipate
that whether one grows through the benefit of being surrounded by intellectual
talents depends on factors beyond grades, such as a student’s grade aspiration(Khattab, 2015) and parents’ opinion about the importance of grades(Yau et al., 2021). This is because we believe a student’s values and parents’ values would influence how the student would perceive one’s academic standing in the network and subsequently the resulting behaviour.
