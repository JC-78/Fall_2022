Senior Thesis: Many have investigated the social influence on academic performance in an academic setting using network theory. 
However, they do not account for a student’s relative academic standing. 
This matters because one’s relative academic standing could either encourage the student to work harder or make the student become complacent.
We want to fill this gap by comparing the effects of being the one with lowest GPA/QPA and being the one with highest GPA/QPA in a social network in an
academic environment.
